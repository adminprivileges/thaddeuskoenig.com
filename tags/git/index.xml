I was wrong and the changes were going directly to main. This isnt really a huge issue since the repo is only for me, but I&amp;rsquo;m typing this out so hopefully I dont make this mistake somewhere it actually matters and so I can have the steps to fix it id it does.</description></item></channel></rss>
