Because of this the need to monitor temperature readings in rooms became a little more important, now there&amp;rsquo;s a multitude of different ways to tackle this problem but this is by far the cheapest (although more time consuming on the front end) and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any cloud services to keep it running.</description></item><item><title>400: Bad Request in HomeAssistant</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_400_bad_request_ha-copy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_400_bad_request_ha-copy/</guid><description>So for some reason in v2021.7.0 HomeAssistant introduced a bug that breaks a lot of systems that rely on its NGINX reverse proxy add-on to provide ssl capabilities.

I believe the issue stems from needing to change your virtual disk to IDE instead of SCSI which causes some underlying hard drive integrity issues that they didn&amp;rsquo;t plan for. Nonetheless, the fix is pretty easy and just takes a couple of minutes on your time and a Linux terminal (or any terminal that can SSH I guess).</description></item><item><title>VMware Vmmod/VMnet Install</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_vmware_vmod_install/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_vmware_vmod_install/</guid><description>After upgrading my Ubuntu Version and subsequently my kernel I tried running VMware Workstation Pro so I could access my VMs and kept running into the following error code when trying to open the application. Unfortunately, there was no way around it as rebooting, uninstalling/reinstalling, and anything else in my usual low-hanging fruit bag of tricks didn&amp;rsquo;t work so I had to really figure out what was really going on. Lets start with the actual error.</description></item></channel></rss>
