      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever find yourself wanting to access machines, but due to the permissions of he computer you&amp;rsquo;re currently on or network restrictions you&amp;rsquo;re unable to do so? Or maybe you have users that you would like to have access to remote machines, but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to worry about what remote administration tools they have on their devices. Guacamole is cool because it allows a user to access Windows and Linux machines through a variety of different protocols such as SSH, RDP, or VNC through a web browser as all of the tools are separated from the client machine and resident on the server side meaning administration can be done on any computing device capable of web browsing to prove it, once we have this set up i will access a remote machine via my PlayStation 4. I’m a huge fan of web apps and this is one of my favorites so today I’m gonna show you how to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
