      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people see VPN and they think of the commercial, hide myself within another million people’s traffic, product such as Nord or PIA. But this article is simply an interesting take on the technology used to bridge the physical gap between work-spaces that many professionals both technical and not became intimately familiar with over the recent 2021 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-nebula-and-how-is-it-different&#34;&gt;What is Nebula and how is it different?&lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-nebula-and-how-is-it-different&#34; class=&#34;post-heading__anchor&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a traditional sense a VPN functions as a router that bridges different LANs over an encrypted tunnel, and the traffic passed between LANs travels much like traditional traffic would when passed between LANs, in a star-like topology where all traffic destined for a peer must first pass through a switching/routing device, but what if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case? What if you could simply cut out the middle man and pass traffic directly between networked nodes in a VPN network? That’s exactly what Nebula brings to the table.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
