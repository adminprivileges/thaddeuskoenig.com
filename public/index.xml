      <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much access to technology and wasnt really aware of the magic possible with computers. I&amp;rsquo;m a lifelong learner and love finding out new things that computers can do. I&amp;rsquo;m extremely grateful for my ability to work in technology which allows me to turn my curiosity to a profession. I enjoy using technology to scratch my own personal itches as well as experiment with new ways to solve problems with tech. I am also extremely passionate in digital privacy, security, and privacy although finding a balalce of pragmatism and convienence can be a bit of an issue. I try to be practically dilligent for my own life as well as educate others on how to do the same. I am by no means an expert or as much of a hermit as I would like to be sometimes., i&amp;rsquo;m just a guy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
