Below is a simple graphic that I made that illustrates the process of the key exchange.
So what does this mean? Well asymetric cryptography is built upon the idea of creating a shared secret independently without passing it over the public internet.</description></item><item><title>02JAN25 - NixOS</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/20250102/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 16:04:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/20250102/</guid><description>So I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything today so I&amp;rsquo;m going to take today to write about NixOS. I started using NixOS recently because I would like to incorporate declarative and immutable operating systems into my research. I was introduced to NixOS via one of my favorite podcasts Linux Unplugged. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t initially sold on it because it sounded like a fad, but so far its pretty cool. This is how I understand it.</description></item><item><title>01JAN25 - Hugo Site Plans</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/20250101/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 10:04:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/20250101/</guid><description>Hello, this is the beginning of my (somewhat) daily blog. The intention of this blog is less of an exercise in writing about my life and more of a exercise in making a habit of documentation. I plan to write daily about lessons I learned about computers that day and I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be a non-computer related blog or two. When I implement tagging and search, I will make sure that things are tagged appropriately.</description></item><item><title>/bin/bash^M: bad interpreter</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_bash_bad_interpreter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_bash_bad_interpreter/</guid><description>Bash scripts are very sensitive to line endings which can cause some portability issues between windows and unix-like systems (depending on how the text editor encodes line breaks). If you would like to see the invisible characters that are making your life confusing simply type:
cat -v &amp;lt;FILE&amp;gt; The easiest solution to this issue is a simple sed replace line:

#!/bin/bash#Install nginxapt install nginx#Checks for your default nginx file and deletes itFILE=/etc/nginx/conf.</description></item><item><title>Change Proxmox to DHCP Client</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_change_proxmox_to_dhcp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_change_proxmox_to_dhcp/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t really like like allowing servers to set their own IP addresses, i think its kinda weird and i like to handle things at the network level so I typically have all my servers as DHCP clients and I set their addresses statically on the network device they&amp;rsquo;re attached to. Unfortunately proxmox doesn&amp;rsquo;t like that so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t include DHCP in the installer, which is fine. Its easily fixed.</description></item><item><title>Clear Home Assistant Refresh Tokens</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_clear_has_refresh/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_clear_has_refresh/</guid><description>As much as I love Home assistant there are some small papercuts that can make it annoying to deal with, this is one of them. Every time you elect to &amp;ldquo;stay signed in&amp;rdquo; and you don&amp;rsquo;t sign out before exiting the page you&amp;rsquo;ll have a nice token sitting in this long list of your previous mistakes. I found this quick fix on Reddit, but understand that this will clear ALL the tokens in your home assistant (even the session that youre currently in) so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to log back in.</description></item><item><title>Connecting ProxMox cluster over Tailscale</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_proxmox_over_tailscale/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_proxmox_over_tailscale/</guid><description>This tutorial is assuming that you already have Tailscale installed on your Proxmox hosts, if you havent done so look at the installation for Tailscale on Debaian Bullseye.
Install# Because /etc/hosts has priority in all host lookups we are just going to edit the these files on any of the machines that we would like to connect. To do so you can simply vim /etc/hosts and your new host files will end up looking like this with host being the node you want to start the cluster on and remote being the node that will join the cluster</description></item><item><title>Copy ssh keys without ssh-copy-id</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_coppy_ssh_keys/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_coppy_ssh_keys/</guid><description>I ran into this issue today so I thought that i would put a solution that I found on here. If you ever run into a situation in which you need to copy your ssh keys to another box but you dont have the handy dandy ssh-copy-id tool, the following one liner should work. Check out this oracle web page for more info.

So Primarily you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to power off the VM you want to clone.
Then you want to right click the VM and chose Edit Settings.
In the Virtual Hardware tab take not of the name and location of your Disk File.</description></item><item><title>Object type requires hosted I/O in HASOS on ESXI</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_object_type_hasos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_object_type_hasos/</guid><description>So for some reason that Home Assistant OS virtual machine doesn&amp;rsquo;t really like being on certain versions of Vmware ESXI (typically older versions as I assume they do their testing as close to the newer releases as possible). I believe the issue stems from needing to change your virtual disk to IDE instead of SCSI which causes some underlying hard drive integrity issues that they didn&amp;rsquo;t plan for. Nonetheless, the fix is pretty easy and just takes a couple of minutes on your time and a Linux terminal (or any terminal that can SSH I guess).</description></item><item><title>Proxmox Delete Cluster</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_proxmox_delete_cluster/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_proxmox_delete_cluster/</guid><description>Theres no real way to delete a cluster in the gui with out doing a fresh install (that i know of) but the following set of commands should stop the cluster service, force it to local, delete the configs and restart it like new.

Different hypervisors use different file formats to represent VM images and due to the fact that Proxmox uses Qemu (Quick Emulator)/KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) to provide virtualization, it in turn uses Qcow2 (Qemu Copy-On-Write) as the storage file format for virtual machines data. The process to move Qcow2 files into Proxmox may not be as straight forward as it is on VMware, but its still a relatively painless process.</description></item><item><title>Pull public keys from Github url</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_pull_pulic_keys_git/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_pull_pulic_keys_git/</guid><description>If you ever want a simple way to pull your public keys from Github so that you can use your safely stored ssh private keys where you need them.

Thankfully the delimiter is pretty flexible. I like to use the pipe &amp;ldquo;|&amp;rdquo; symbol, but pretty much any other symbol will work such as the tilde &amp;ldquo;`&amp;rdquo; or the colon &amp;ldquo;:&amp;rdquo; ex:</description></item><item><title>Setting Up Omada SMTP with Gmail</title><link>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_setup_omada_gmail/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://thaddeuskoenig.com/blog/00_legacy_setup_omada_gmail/</guid><description>In order to get proper email notifications from the TP-link Omada SDN Controller you need to set up SMTP and have it authenticate to your email provider of choice (here we&amp;rsquo;re gong to use gmail).
